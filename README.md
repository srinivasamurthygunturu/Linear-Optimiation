Furniture Inc. makes two products, tables and chairs, which are processed through the Assembly and Finishing departments. Assembly can handle up to 150 hours of work per week. Finishing has 42hours available per week. Manufacturing one table requires:10 hours of assembly and 2 hours of finishing. Manufacturing one chair requires:5 hours of assembly and 3 hours of finishing. If the profit is $8 per table and $6 per chair, determine the number of chairs and tables to be produced so the total profit is maximized
